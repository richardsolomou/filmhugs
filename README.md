FilmHugs
=======

This is my code for the Discrete Mathematics and Functional Programming unit coursework (year 2) that I was assessed in during my studies for a BSc (Hons) Computer Science degree at the University of Portsmouth.

Specification
-------------
This coursework assessment had us to construct a website that would support an easily updateable and customizable online shopping store for selling all kinds of physical products.

My task was to write a program in Haskell for a film ratings website that lets users add films, say which films they like, and display the details of various films. The website maintains a “database” of many films; each record of which gives a film's title, the main cast members, the year of release, and a list of users of the website who are fans of the film.

I was instructed to begin by developing purely functional code to cover most of the required functionality, and then add to this the functions/actions that will comprise the program’s user interface, assuming that no two films have the same title – i.e. any film can be uniquely identified by its title.

Aims
----
My main aims and intentions related to the final product are listed below:
* Keep functional and interface code separate
* Aesthetically pleasing to use design
* Use more than one function where needed
* Room for improvement

(FilmHugs was named after WinHugs, the Windows user interface to Hugs, a functional programming system based on Haskell 98)
